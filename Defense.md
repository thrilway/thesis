# Why Resultatives?
- Two of the Main Questions of linguistics: 
	* **How much can languages vary from one another?**
	* **How do children acquire their language?**
- In fact these are two sides of the same coin
	* Universals don't need to be learned,
	* so children only acquire that which varies.
- *a priori* we can only learn what we have evidence for.
- Adjectival resultatives are puzzling in light of these considerations.
	* They're parameterized, but not in an obviously learnable way.
