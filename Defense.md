# Why Resultatives?
- Two of the Main Questions of linguistics: 
	* **How much can languages vary from one another?**
	* **How do children acquire their language?**
- In fact these are two sides of the same coin
	* Universals don't need to be learned,
	* so children only acquire that which varies.
- *a priori* we can only learn what we have evidence for.
- Adjectival resultatives are puzzling in light of these considerations.
	* They're parameterized, but not in an obviously learnable way.
- The parameter: 
	* In some languages (@SPTemplate) can be interpreted as depictive or resultative
	* In others (@SPTemplate) can be interpreted only as depictive

(@SPTemplate) [~TP~ DP [~VP~ V NP AP]]

- There's no reliable evidence for interpretations
	* How is this parameter setting learned?
- Snyder's correlation fixes the learnability issue:
	* The resultative parameter is set indirectly on the basis of the compounding parameter.
- This leaves us with the problem of linking compounds to resultatives
	* Compounding is an SM-oriented phenomenon
	* Adjectival resultative construction is a CI-oriented phenomenon.
- So how can we link the two?
- There are three theoretical routes available to us for explaining any variation:

1. Only surface variation
2. Lexical Parameterization Hypothesis (LPH)
3. Parameter theory.

- From a minimalist perspective, 1 is the most attractive.
	* The CI-orientation of resultatives points away from it, though.
- 3 is problematic for a number of reasons.
	* See section 3.1.2.2
- This leaves 2: LPH
