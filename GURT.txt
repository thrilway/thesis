While all languages allow for secondary predication constructions, languages vary with as to whether those those constructions can be interpreted as resultatives.
This is a particularly puzzling type of variation, because resultatives are superficially indistinguishable from other types of secondary predication.
It is not obvious how this variation could be acquired directly from the primary linguistic data.

<+Snyder+> argues that resultatives are correlated with productive compounding but does not articulate how the two disparate properties might be related.
A generative analysis of resultatives (<+Kratzer+>) has been able to derive adjectival resultatives but has not provided an account of their variable nature.
Modern generative styntactic theory (<+Chomsky+>), however, offers a way to synthesize these two approaches.
