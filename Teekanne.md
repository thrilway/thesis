#The puzzle

* In Chapter 3 of my thesis, I define a new version of UTAH:

(@UTAH) **Minimal UTAH**\
If a thematic relation *f* holds between items X and Y in distinct expressions S~1~ and S~2~, then there is a single structural relation *g* that also holds between X and Y in both S~1~ and S~2~.

* To diagnose thematic relations, I use entailment relationships such as:
	
(@Causative) Sarah broke the bottle

(@Inchoative) The bottle broke

* That (@Causative) entails (@Inchoative) is evidence that some particular structural relationship holds between *the bottle* and *broke* in both (@Causative) and (@Inchoative).
