\begin{document}
This thesis is within the minimalist program, which does not mean that I necessarily assume a particular theory of grammar, but that I take ths Strong Minimalist Thesis (SMT) to be the guiding methodological axiom of linguistic inquiry.

The SMT, which has been formulated in a number of ways, states that language is an optimal solution to the problem of generating structures which are legible to the Sensorimotor (SM) and Conceptual-Intentional (CI) interfaces.
In Chomsky's words, SMT ``becomes an empirical thesis insofar as we are able to determine interface conditions and to clarify notions of `good design.''' \parencite[1]{chomsky2001derivation}
