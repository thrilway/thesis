In this section I will address two questions which \textcite{chomsky2013problems,chomsky2015problems} largely leaves open.
First there is the question of how to label Host-Adjunct structures.
These are cases of XP-YP structures, but generally involve neither movement of host or adjunct, nor agreement between the two.
Chomsky's LA, then, would crash when processing these structures.
I propose, following \textcite{hornstein2009theory} and \textcite{chametzky1996theory}, that Host-Adjunct structures are unlabelled.
How is it that a structure can be unlabelled?
To answer this question we must consider the nature of the labelling process. 

If we consider the labelling process to be a function Label from unlabelled structures to labelled structures, then an unlabelled structure is an impossible output of Label.
If Host-Adjunct structures are unlabelled, then they cannot be the output of Label.
This means one of two things, either Host-Adjunct structures are not interpreted at the CI interface, or they bypass Label.
The first possibility seems to be contradicted by the fact that Adjuncts are interpreted at CI, so I will follow the second possibility.
Consider, then, a structure [XP, ZP], where XP is a host and ZP is an adjunct.
The structure as a whole will bypass Label, but the host XP will be labelled.
It is reasonable to assume, then, that the adjunct ZP will bypass Label, meaning its internal structure will not be labelled in this cycle of Label.

The second question is why labels should be required by the CI interface at all.
My proposed answer is that the label of a complex object determines how that object composes semantically.
While this may seem \textit{ad hoc}, it is actually a quite reasonable hypothesis.
Consider Chomsky's labelling hypothesis as phrased in \Next, and the more standard theory of the CI interface in \NNext.
\ex. A syntactic object is a valid CI object iff it is labellable.

\ex. A syntactic object is a valid CI object iff it composes semantically.

At first glance, these hypotheses are incompatible, giving us three options at resolving the conflict.
The first option would be to reject one of the conflicting hypotheses.
There is no strong evidence, however, to reject either \LLast or \Last, so I will not choose this option.
The second option is to conjoin the iff clauses as in \Next.
\ex. A syntactic object is a valid CI object iff it is labellable and it composes semantically.

This option is unattractive for reasons of theoretical parsimony, so I will not choose it.
The third option is to hypothesize that labelling and composition are identical, and therefore the conflicting hypotheses are equivalent.

The simplest cases are those structures labelled by heads.
The classes of structures which get head labels are given in \Next.
\ex. \textbf{Head-labelled structures}
\a. $\left\{ \text{X, }\textsc{Root} \right\} \xrightarrow{Label} \left[_\text{X} \text{X, }\textsc{root}  \right]$
\b. $\left\{ \text{X, YP} \right\} \xrightarrow{Label} \left[_\text{X} \text{X, YP} \right]$
\c. $\left\{ t_\text{ZP}, \left\{ \text{X, YP} \right\} \right\}\xrightarrow{Label}\left[_\text{X} t_\text{ZP}, \text{XP} \right]$

I propose that in these cases, the objects compose by function application, with the label being the function and the non-labelling constituent being the argument.
So, for instance, a DP is interpreted as the function D, with NP as an argument.
\ex. \textsc{sem}($\left[_\textit{the} \textit{the, ball} \right]$) = \textsc{sem}(\textit{the})(\textsc{sem}(\textit{ball}))

The next case is that of structures labelled by feature-pairs.
These structures, tend to be the result of internal Merge, which is generally associated with operator-variable structures.
I hypothesize, then, that feature-pair labels signal that a complex object is to be interpreted as an operator-variable structure.
For instance the Wh-question structure in \Next[a] is interpreted as in \Next[b].
\ex. \textsc{sem}($\left[_{\langle Q,Q \rangle} \textit{Who}_Q, \left[ \text{C}_Q+\textit{did}, \left[ \textit{Mary see } t_{Who} \right] \right]  \right]$) = (Wh\textit{x})(\textsc{sem}(\textit{Mary saw x}))

Finally, the case of unlabelled structures, which is identical to the case of Host-Adjunct structures.
In this case, objects compose by conjunction.
Consider the interpretation of the structure in \Next.
\ex. \textsc{sem}($\left[_\emptyset \textit{run, swiftly} \right]$) =  $(\lambda e)(\textsc{sem}(\textit{run})(e) \& \textsc{sem}(\textit{swiftly})(e))$
