Another issue with my account has to do with the sideward movement operation.
Recall that in order to derive an adjectival resultative, a DP must move sideward from the resP adjunct to the VP as in \cref{fig:ResStruct}.
Note also that that sideward movement operation seems to be obligatory, that is, the DP that originates in the resP must also appear as the theme of the VP.
This obligatoriness can be seen in the fact that \cref{ex:double-theme-res} is ungrammatical.
\ex.*  Sam [$_{VP}$ hammered the nail] [$_{resP}$ the planks together].\label{ex:double-theme-res}\\
($\approx$ Sam hammered the nail and, as a result, the planks were fastened together)

An easy way of accounting for this would be to hypothesize that it is due to some property of the res head, and if this obligatory sideward movement were particular to resultatives, then, indeed, this would likely be the best way to proceed.
However, sideward wovement seems to be obligatory in other cases.
First, there is the case of depictives, which differ from resultatives only in the fact that they lack a res head.
Also, as I will argue in this chapter, certain so-called ACC-ing clauses in direct perception reports such as the embedded clause in \cref{ex:ACCing1} 
\ex. We heard [them shouting at the top of their lungs].\label{ex:ACCing1}

Furthermore, I will argue that this obligatory sideward movement is, in fact, a property of adjoined phrases.
Specifically, the generalization in \cref{ex:AdjunctGen} seems to hold.
\ex. <++>\label{ex:AdjunctGen}

Such a generalization, I argue cannot be accounted for in theory of grammar based on feature satisfaction.
Label theory, however, is able in principle to derive this generalization, but in order to do so, it must be modified and extended.
I will perfom such an extension and show that this modified label theory can derive \cref{ex:AdjunctGen}.

\section{On ACC-ing clauses}

\textcite{cinque1996pseudo} discusses ACC-ing clauses (ACs) under direct preception verbs as in \cref{ex:ACCingDPR} and argues that they are ambiguous, having the two structures in \cref{ex:ACCingStructs}.\footnote{
	The main object of Cinque's study, in fact, is pseudo relatives such as those in \cref{ex:PR}, which he argues are ambiguous between the three structures in \cref{ex:PRStructs}
	\ex.\label{ex:PR}
	\a. Ho visto Mario che correva a tutta velocit\'a. (Italian)
	\b. J'ai vu Mario qui courrait \'a tout vitesse. (French)

	\ex.\label{ex:PRStruct}
	\a. Ho [visto [$_\text{NP}$ Mario [$_\text{CP}$] che correva \ldots ]]
	\b. Ho [visto [$_\text{CP}$ Mario [$_{\text{C}^\prime}$ che [$_\text{IP}$ correva \ldots ]]]]
	\c. Ho [[visto Mario] [$_\text{CP}$ \textit{ec} che correva \ldots]]

	He mentions ACs briefly in order to point out that his remarks and claims about pseudo relatives largely apply to ACs.
	The main difference between the two constructions is that ACs are not analyzable as nominals, but a related form with nominal morphology serves this function.
	\ex. [Their shouting at the top of their lungs] didn't help matters.

}
\ex. I saw Mario running at full speed. \label{ex:ACCingDPR} 

\ex.\label{ex:ACCingStructs}
\a. I [saw [$_\text{ProgP}$ Mario [$_{\text{Prog}^\prime}$ -ing [$_\text{VP}$ run \ldots]]]].
\b. I [[saw Mario] [$_\text{ProgP}$ \textit{ec} running \ldots]].

These two structure, or, rather, the fact that a single grammar can generate both of these structures, present a serious problem for standard theories of grammar.
As such, I will discuss them in greater detail below.

In one structure, represented in \cref{fig:CompACCing}, the AC is merged as the complement of the perception verb.
The interpretation of this structure is one in which the running event was seen and by virtue of the meaning of \textit{run}, seeing a running event generally entail seeing the agent of that event.

	    ]
    ]
\end{forest}
	\caption{Complement ACC-ing structure}
	\label{fig:CompACCing}
\end{figure}
In the second structure, represented in \cref{fig:AdjunctACCing}, the ACC-ing subject is merged as the complement of the perception verb, while the AC (with a controlled subject) is adjoined to the VP.
The interpretation of this structure is one in which \textit{him} is seen and the event of \textit{him} being seen coincides with an event of \textit{him} running.
Again in this interpretation, due to the meaning for \textit{run}, seeing the agent of a running event generally entails seeing that event.
\begin{figure}[h]

	    ]
    ]
\end{forest}
	\caption{Adjunct ACC-ing structure}
	\label{fig:AdjunctACCing}
\end{figure}
By the assumptions of this thesis, the argument \textit{Mario} can only be shared by the verb \textit{see} and the verb \textit{run} if it is merged with both, meaning it must move from [Spec, Prog] to [Comp, V].
In the case of the complement AC in \cref{fig:CompACCing}, however, the argument \textit{Mario} seems to stay in situ in [Spec, Prog], suggesting that the movemnt operation represented in \cref{fig:AdjunctACCing} is, in fact, optional.
If the movement operation is optional, however, we would expect two additional structures for \cref{ex:ACCingDPR}: one, represented in \cref{fig:CompACCingMove}, in which the ProgP is the complement of \textit{saw} and \textit{Mario} has moved from [Spec, Prog], and another, represented in \cref{fig:AdjunctACCingStay}, in which the ProgP is an adjunct, but \textit{Mario} does not move from [Spec, Prog].

	\caption{Adjunct ACC-ing structure without DP movement}
	\label{fig:AdjunctACCingStay}
\end{figure}
If we consider the consequences of this proposed optionality, we can see that it is not true.

First, consider the structure in \cref{fig:AdjunctACCingStay}, in particular the fact that \textit{see} does not have an internal argument.
This is not \textit{per se} problematic, as verbs may be optionally transitive, but we would expect that \textit{see} could have an internal argument other than \textit{Mario}.
That is, if \cref{fig:AdjunctACCingStay} is a possible structure for \cref{ex:ACCingDPR}, then we would expect that \cref{ex:ACCingDouble} to be a licit sentence.
\ex.* I [$_\text{VP}$ [$_\text{VP}$ saw Sue] [$_\text{ProgP}$ Mario running at full speed]]. \label{ex:ACCingDouble}

If \textit{Mario} can remain in [Spec, Prog], then we have no way to rule out \textit{Sue} merging with \textit{see} and behaving as a direct object.
Of course, \cref{ex:ACCingDouble} is ungrammatical, suggesting that \textit{Mario} cannot remain in [Spec, Prog] if ProgP is adjoined to VP.
Movement from [Spec, Prog], then, cannot be optional, strictly speaking.
If it is not optional, perhaps it is obligatory.

If movemnt from [Spec, Prog] is obligatory, then we must revise Cinque's analysis of complement ACs.
Suppose, then, that \textit{Mario}, in the complement ACC-ing analysis of \cref{ex:ACCingDPR}, must raise to object.
In other words, suppose \cref{fig:CompACCingMove} is a possible structure of \cref{ex:ACCingDPR} and \cref{fig:CompACCing} is not.
Note that in \cref{fig:CompACCingMove}, \textit{Mario} is the grammatical object but not the theme of \textit{see}.
If this is the case then we expect that \textit{Mario} can become the subject of a passive derived from \cref{fig:CompACCingMove}.

Indeed, subjects of ACs can become passive subjects as in \cref{ex:ACCingPassive}, but it is not immediately obvious whether \cref{ex:ACCingPassive} is derived from an Adjunct AC structure or a Complement AC structure.
\ex. Mario was seen running at full speed. \label{ex:ACCingPassive}

If \cref{ex:ACCingPassive} had been derived from a Complement ACC-ing structure, however, then \textit{Mario} would not have been $\theta$-marked by \textit{see}.
So, in order to test whether passives like \cref{ex:ACCingPassive} can be generated in which the subject is not interpreted as the theme of the verb, that is, we need a clause of the form in \cref{ex:ACCingPassiveTempl} where the event of V-ing was perceived without the individual X being perceived.
\ex. X was $\left\{ \text{seen/heard/felt} \right\}$ V-ing \ldots
s
There are certain classes of predicate which we can use as diagnostics due to a non-canonical event/argument structure.
Consider the ACC-ing versions of weather reports and clausal idioms, for instance, as given in \cref{ex:ACCingWeather} and \cref{ex:ACCingIdiom}
\ex. Bill saw it snowing. $\centernot\implies$ Bill saw it. \label{ex:ACCingWeather}

\ex. Bill heard all hell breaking loose. $\centernot\implies$ Bill saw all hell. \label{ex:ACCingIdiom}

Consider, also, the predicates \textit{be slandered} and \textit{be parodied}.
Events of parodying or slandering an individual $x$ generally do not include $x$ as a participant the way, for instance, events of hitting $x$ or speaking to \textit{x} do.
This is demonstrated in \cref{ex:ACCingSlander} and \cref{ex:ACCingParody}
\ex. We heard the writer being slandered. $\centernot\implies$ We heard the writer. \label{ex:ACCingSlander}

\ex. They saw the singer being parodied. $\centernot\implies$ They saw the singer. \label{ex:ACCingParody}

Unlike most direct perception reports with ACs, then, \crefrange{ex:ACCingWeather}{ex:ACCingParody} are not ambiguous.
Rather, they have only the complement AC structures.
Therefore, if the perception reports in \crefrange{ex:ACCingWeather}{ex:ACCingParody} can be passivized, this will be evidence for the proposal that DPs are able to move out of complement ACs.
In fact, it seems that they cannot be passivized.
\ex.* It was seen raining.

\ex.* All hell was heard breaking loose.

\ex.* The writer was heard being slandered.

\ex.* The singer was seen being parodied.

I can think of no principled explanation of these facts except to propose that DP movement out of a complement AC is barred.
Absent any evidence or argument to the contrary, then, I will assume the Cinque's initial analysis of complement ACs was correct.

Thus we are led to the following generalization with respect to ACs:
If an AC is adjoined to a VP, then its subject must move, but if an AC is merged as the complement of a verb, then its subject is cannot move.
This is an unexpected, perhaps unprecedented syntactic generalization.
In fact, I will argue in the following section that it is predicted to be impossible by any theory that defines grammaticality solely in terms of feature satisfaction, as standard minimalist theories do.
\section{Feature satisfaction cannot account for ACC-ing clauses}
As I discussed in \cref{sec:nonstandard}, standard minimalist theories tend to assume that a derived syntactic object converges at the interfaces iff it contains no unsatisfied features.
There is, of course, debate as to what it means of a feature to be unsatisfied, and what sort of operations are able to satisfy these features.
Therefore, I will attempt to abstract away from the details of particular theories and discuss what I take to be their shared assumptions.

The first common assumption (or set of assumptions) is with regards to features.
Lexical items bear or consist of features, each of which is inherently either satisfied or unsatisfied, and each of which is also specified for the information it encodes (person, gender, tense, etc.).
For instance, a determiner may bear a satisfied definiteness feature and an unsatisfied Case feature.

The second common assumption is that some computational operation converts a token of some unsatisfied feature into a token of a satisfied feature under the influence of some other feature token.
In order for feature F on lexical item X to satisfy feature G on lexical item Y, X an Y must stand in some structural relation to each other, and F and G must be of the same type.
Furthermore, feature satisfaction is automatic and reflexive; if the conditions are right for F to satisfy G, then F satisfies G.

The third common assumption, is that there is no operation which undoes feature satisfaction.
This is never made explicit, but it is nonetheless assumed to be true.
Such an assumption, in effect, ensures a certain monotonicity in syntactic derivations, in that if at some derivational stage S$_n$ feature F is satisfied, then there is no later stage S$_{n+i} (i > 0)$ at which F is unsatisfied.

The fourth common assumption, which I already alluded to, is that a syntactic object is well-formed iff it contains no lexical items with any unsatified features.
This will be used as a diagnostic for satisfied features.
If a sentence, phrase, or word is well-formed, then it must contain no unsatisfied features.
