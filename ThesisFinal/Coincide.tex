In this thesis I have made liberal use of a novel class of sideward movement structure which I schematize below in \cref{fig:SidewardSchema}.

This structure was used as an analysis of adjectival resultatives, depictives, and one available structure for direct perception reports with ACC-ing clauses.
The distinction between these constructions is due to the choice of head Y.
For resultatives, Y is instantiated by res, while for precetion reports, it is instatntiated by Prog.
As for depictives, the adjoined phrase YP is a small clause, so Y is either absent or instantiated by a Pred head.
Note that, while the complement of Y, ZP, also varies between the constructions, this variation can be derived from the selectional requirements of Y.

If we take VPs to be event descriptions, and we assume that host-adjunct structures to compose by predicate conjunction, then a VP adjunct (SC for depictives, resP for resultatives, and ProgP for DPRs) must also be event description.
That is, in \cref{fig:SidewardSchema} the VP and YP are each interpreted as a predicate of events, and, because they combine by predicate conjunction, they both describe the same event.

In the case of depictives, the interpretation is mostly straightforward, though not without come complications.
Consider \cref{ex:Depictive}, which an eventuality in which Natasha eats the fish while that fish is raw.
\ex. Natasha ate the fish raw.

According to our analysis, this interpretation would be derived from the fact that the eating event and the rawness state are taken to to be identical.
That is the VP in \cref{ex:Depictive} has a logical form in \cref{ex:DepictiveLF}
\ex. $\textbf{eating}(e) \& \textbf{raw}(e) \& \textbf{the\_fish}(x) \textsc{Theme}(x)(e)$
