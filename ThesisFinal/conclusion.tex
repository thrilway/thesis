\begin{document}
The parametric variation of resultative, what I call the resultative parameter, presents a puzzle for linguistic theory:
Children acquire their language's parameter-setting despite a seeming lack of direct evidence in the primary linguistic data.
Since there is no direct evidence, the parameter setting must follow from indirect evidence.
This line of reasoning leads to a two-part research question:
What aspect of a child's PLD provides indirect evidence for the setting of the resultative parameter, and how is the parameter setting deduced from that aspect?
Each part of that question, it turns out, calls for a dissertation-length answer.
The first part is largely answered by William Snyder's dissertation \parencite{snyder1995language} and refined in his later work \parencite{snyder2001nature,snyder2012parameter,snyder2016compound}.
Snyder's answer is that children use the availability of bare stem compounding in their PLD as indirect evidence for the availability of resultatives in their target grammar.
My disseration begins with this result, and aims to provide an answer to the second part of the question: 
A language may generate both bare stem compounds and adjectival resultatives only if its lexicon has categorizing heads without $\varphi$-features.

Answering the question ``How are resultatives linked to bare stem compounding?'' is a theoretical task, and, as with any theoretical task, it begins with an explicit litany of theoretical assumptions.
I make many of assumptions standardly made in early \nth{21} century generative syntax (Merge, the Y-model of grammar) and a number of non-standard assumptions.
First, I assume that the $\Theta$-criterion does not fully hold, and that an argument may receive multiple $\theta$-roles.
Second, I assume that Merge operates freely, provided that there are two syntactic objects to be combined.
finally, I assume that there is no operation Agree active in the Narrow Syntax.
These assumptions, as I discuss in \cref{sec:nonstandard}, despite being non-standard, actually follow from the logic of the minimalist program.

In order to provide any answer to the question of how resultatives are related to bare stem compounds, we must have an idea of what adjectival resultatives are.
That is, we must give a syntactic analysis of resultatives.
Furthermore, we must provide what I call a parametric analysis---an analysis of how a parameter may be acquired and represented in the grammar.
To that end, I discuss previous analyses in \cref{sec:litreview} before offering my own in \cref{sec:analysis}.
The syntactic analysis I offer, reproduced in \cref{fig:hammer-flat-conc}, is one in which a result phrase is adjoined to the VP and a DP undergoes sideward movement between them.

The parametric analysis, I offer is based on a similar one by \textcite{kratzer2004building}.
According to this analysis, the presence of bare stem compounding in a child's PLD signals that the child's lexicon should admit categorizing heads without $\varphi$-features.

In order to show that resultatives depend on $\varphi$-less heads, we must show that a structure such as \cref{fig:hammer-flat-conc} can be derived only if the lexicon contains $\varphi$-less categorizing heads.
I do so in \cref{sec:deriving}, but only after discussing the latest iteration (at least at the time of this thesis) of Chomsky's syntactic theory---label theory---in \cref{sec:labels}.
According to label theory, a syntactic derivation only converges if the structure it creates can be unambiguously labelled.
In \cref{sec:deriving}, I show that the structure in \cref{fig:hammer-flat-conc} can be derived and labelled if the result adjective \textit{flat} is categorized by a $\varphi$-less head $adj_{\emptyset}$.
I then show that if \textit{flat} is categorized by $adj_{\varphi}$, the derivation either fails or creates an unlabellable structure.
Thus I have answered the question at hand.

In part II, I bring to the forefront the apparently loose theoretical ends left by Part I.
Rather than tie these loose ends up with auxiliary or ad-hoc hypotheses, I investigate how they might inform our theory of the language faculty.
In \cref{sec:FreSC}, I argue that an apparent undergeneration problem of my proposed theory is actually due to the lack of a suitable theory of feature agreement.
Such a theory, I propose, is one in which agreement occurs postsyntactically.

In \cref{sec:ACCing}, I point out an odd fact---that movement from [Spec, res] to [Comp, V] in \cref{fig:hammer-flat-conc} seems to be obligatory---and show that it seems to generalize to other cases of sideward movement---objects in the specifier of adjoined phrases must move to the host phrase.
I argue that this fact is odd only if we make the standard (although often tacit) assumption that grammaticality is determined within the Narrow Syntax.
Under an interface-based theory, such as label theory, this fact can be accounted for.

Finally, in \cref{sec:coincidence} I discuss a semantic question raised by my proposal.
I assume that primary and secondary predicates compose via something like predicate modification. 
This mode of composition leads to what initially seem to be odd interpretations in which the the events described by the two predicates are in fact the same event.
I argue that despite this apparent oddness, there is no other principled way of interpreting the structures in question (\textit{i.e.}, resultatives, depictives, and some direct perception reports), and furthermore, that the apparent oddness is only apparent.
A closer look at both structures and the ontology of eventualities significantly diminishes this oddness.

The proposals made here are, of course, provisional as is the case for any scientific proposal.
That is, they are subject to revisions, clarifications, and perhaps outright refutation.
That said, I believe that with this thesis I have made two broad contributions to the ongoing study of the human language faculty.
First, I have presented a template for the explanation of parametric variation, especially parametric semantic variation.
Such variation can be explained by first finding a surface correlate of that parameter, and then showing how that correlate can be connected to the parameter.
Second, I have incrementally developed the theory of the language faculty by identifying and fixing flaws in our understanding of such things as the syntax-semantics interface and adjunction.
The flaws were found by applying the logic of the minimalist program to these domains, as were the proposed solutions to those flaws.
I believe my solutions to be intriguing and suggestive, but they may of course be dead ends.
The flaws, themselves, however, are more important; they represent domains that we previously thought we understood.
Finding gaps in our understanding, such as these, is what makes scientific inquiry worth it.
A failure of understanding is merely an opportunity to understand.
