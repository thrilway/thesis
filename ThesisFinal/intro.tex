\begin{document}
This thesis asks a seemingly simple question: Why do some but not all languages allow their users to generate adjectival resultatives?
I write ``seemingly simple'' for reasons that are likely obvious to anyone reading this, but I will clarify the reasons as a way of introducing the actual content of the thesis that follows.
There are, as far as I can tell, two complications inherent in questions of the form \textit{Why P?}: one linguistic, one metaphysical (for lack of a better word).
The linguistic complication is that \textit{Why P?} presupposes that \textit{P}.
So, in order to answer, or even be justified in asking, the question at hand, we must first demonstrate that there is a class of expressions that can be called adjectival resultatives, and that they are not found in every language.
The metaphysical complication is due to the fact that a given \textit{Why} question has an indefinite number of true responses, yet the appropriate response depends on the level of explanation that is sought.
So, In order to answer the stated question, we must clarify the level of explanation we are seeking.
